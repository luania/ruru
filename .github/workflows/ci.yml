        # Just run the build script to ensure it compiles, but don't necessarily package everything if it takes too long.
        # For Electron, 'npm run build' usually includes packaging.
        # We can try to just run the compilation parts if possible, but 'npm run build' is safer to verify everything.
        # Since we don't have a separate compile script, we'll run build but maybe skip the heavy packaging if possible,
        # or just let it run. For CI, it's better to be sure.
